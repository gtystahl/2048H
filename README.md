# 2048H
This is the heuristics assignment where we need to make heuristics that get the AI to win over 50% of the time

To run this, run game manager. It will run ten times by default and put the results in a text file called results.txt

To change the number of runs, it is in the main function of came manager. Change the 'times' variable to the number of times you want it to run.

Should get 2048 50% of the time but if it doesn't, it would get 1024 every other time.
